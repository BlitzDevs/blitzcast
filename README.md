# Overview
< Backstory to be written sometime... >

This game features a *time based mechanic* rather than a traditional turn-based card game,
as well as pixel aesthetics.

# Gameplay
Each player enters the game with their own decks, and gets to have 4 cards in their hand.
When you play a card, it takes some time before it to actually take effect.
During this time, the opponent could counter the card, if he has a counter spell card.
The card does its action after the cast time is finished. After the cast time is finished,
it takes time before another card can be drawn.
